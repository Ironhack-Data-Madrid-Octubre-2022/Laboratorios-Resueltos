![nosotros chorizeando datos](https://conceptodefinicion.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Data_Mining.jpg)

## Introduction
Now that you already figured out how to scrape data from the web using `Beautiful Soup`, it's time to scrape it with `Selenium`.

## Getting Started
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are a bunch of questions to be solved. Each exercise is independent from the previous one. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it. 
1. Import selenium, chrome driver etc... as mentioned in class.
1. Get the same data as in the `main.ipynb` file, but using selenium.

In this lab, you will practice a series of exercises to test your web scraping skills. You will work on your own but remember the teaching staff is at your service whenever you encounter problems.





## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses to each of the exercises.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
