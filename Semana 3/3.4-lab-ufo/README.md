# Lab | Alien invasion

![ufo](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9djqga9zFCiMF8QLu4saRK.jpg)

## Introduction

Our data science team has predicted that the Earth is going to be invaded by an alien force in the
next years. Our only hope is to replicate a device that can block all alien technology in a radius of
~300km. Sadly, the device was sold in 2004 to an anonymous buyer to protect her hometown and
we don't know how contact her again. We know that the device has been active since 2004 in one
city in the USA, and we want to know where to start our search.
We've included a dataset called ​ufo.csv​. This dataset contains over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings
over the last century (all of them verified by the ESA). Using this dataset, try to guess the city in
which the device has been hidden.

## Deliverables

- Your jupyter notebook with your code and conclusions.
- **[Optional]** A picture of the map with the city where the device was hidden.

## Submission

1. Upon completion, add the deliverables to git, commit changes, and submit to github. **Make sure you submit to your own forked repo.**

	```bash
	cd your-code
	git add .
	git commit -m "Lab MySQL solutions"
	git push origin master
	```

1. Navigate to your forked repo and create a Pull Request to the class repo.
	- If you don't remember how to do this, review the lesson in the Prework titled *Git Forking*.
	- Also your instructor and TA will provide support to you.

1. Create a pull request with title following this format: **`[<lab_name>] <your_name>`**
  	- For example, if the lab is *lab-mysql* and your name is *Yonatan Rodriguez*, your pull request name should be something like **`[lab-mysql] Yonatan Rodriguez`**.

1. If you have successfully created the pull request you are done!  CONGRATS :)
